    "In this notebook we showed how machine learning based models, particularly fully connected neural networks, can be trained to learn the relationship between the sub-grid fluxes and the slow variables. This pattern learning exercise is sometimes referred to as offline training, as the skill of the ML model in an actual simulation of the slow variables (gcm) has not been evaluated. In the next notebook we show how these models trained offline can be incorporated into the gcm version of the L96 model, and how its skill can be evaluated."
