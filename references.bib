abstract = {Abstract Attempts to use machine learning to develop atmospheric parameterizations have mainly focused on subgrid effects on temperature and moisture, but subgrid momentum transport is also important in simulations of the atmospheric circulation. Here, we use neural networks to develop a subgrid momentum transport parameterization that learns from coarse-grained output of a high-resolution atmospheric simulation in an idealized aquaplanet domain. We show that substantial subgrid momentum transport occurs due to convection. The neural-network parameterization has skill in predicting momentum fluxes associated with convection, although its skill for subgrid momentum fluxes is lower compared to subgrid energy and moisture fluxes. The parameterization conserves momentum, and when implemented in the same atmospheric model at coarse resolution it leads to stable simulations and tends to reduce wind biases, although it over-corrects for one configuration tested. Overall, our results show that it is challenging to predict subgrid momentum fluxes and that machine-learning momentum parameterization gives promising results.},

abstract = {Abstract Coupled climate simulations that span several hundred years cannot be run at a high-enough spatial resolution to resolve mesoscale ocean dynamics. Recently, several studies have considered Deep Learning to parameterize subgrid forcing within macroscale ocean equations using data from ocean-only simulations with idealized geometry. We present a stochastic Deep Learning parameterization that is trained on data generated by CM2.6, a high-resolution state-of-the-art coupled climate model. We train a Convolutional Neural Network for the subgrid momentum forcing using macroscale surface velocities from a few selected subdomains with different dynamical regimes. At each location of the coarse grid, rather than predicting a single number for the subgrid momentum forcing, we predict both the mean and standard deviation of a Gaussian probability distribution. This approach requires training our neural network to minimize a negative log-likelihood loss function rather than the Mean Square Error, which has been the standard in applications of Deep Learning to the problem of parameterizations. Each estimate of the conditional mean subgrid forcing is thus associated with an uncertainty estimate–the standard deviation—which will form the basis for a stochastic subgrid parameterization. Offline tests show that our parameterization generalizes well to the global oceans and a climate with increased levels without further training. We then implement our learned stochastic parameterization in an eddy-permitting idealized shallow water model. The implementation is stable and improves some statistics of the flow. Our work demonstrates the potential of combining Deep Learning tools with a probabilistic approach in parameterizing unresolved ocean dynamics.},

abstract = {Abstract The use of machine learning to build subgrid parametrizations for climate models is receiving growing attention. State-of-the-art strategies address the problem as a supervised learning task and optimize algorithms that predict subgrid fluxes based on information from coarse resolution models. In practice, training data are generated from higher resolution numerical simulations transformed in order to mimic coarse resolution simulations. By essence, these strategies optimize subgrid parametrizations to meet so-called a priori criteria. But the actual purpose of a subgrid parametrization is to obtain good performance in terms of a posteriori metrics which imply computing entire model trajectories. In this paper, we focus on the representation of energy backscatter in two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic turbulence and compare parametrizations obtained with different learning strategies at fixed computational complexity. We show that strategies based on a priori criteria yield parametrizations that tend to be unstable in direct simulations and describe how subgrid parametrizations can alternatively be trained end-to-end in order to meet a posteriori criteria. We illustrate that end-to-end learning strategies yield parametrizations that outperform known empirical and data-driven schemes in terms of performance, stability, and ability to apply to different flow configurations. These results support the relevance of differentiable programming paradigms for climate models in the future.},
